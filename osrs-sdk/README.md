## What is this project?

This project stemmed from my interest in Old School Runescape's Inferno, and my desire for an open source, relatively clean re-implementation of the Old School Runescape engine. The underlying code is designed closer to a true game engine compared to any other trainer or simulator. The goal is for there to be a clean, well-defined API between all "Game Content" code and any underlying "Engine" code

## What is the lineage of this project?

The [BISTools Line of Sight tool](https://bistools.github.io/inferno.html) inspired [artsicle's inferno tool](https://artsicleofficial.github.io/infernointeractive/inferno.html) which inspired the original 2D Inferno Trainer by [@Tesla Owner](https://github.com/TeslaOwner/), which inspired [@Supalosa](https://github.com/Supalosa/) to both bring an accurate 3D mode as well as the Colosim. 

Without all of these contributors that built upon each other, the polished version we have today would not exist.

## How do I use it?

This is published at `osrs-sdk`. Please see [here](https://github.com/OldSchoolSDK/InfernoTrainer) for example implementations. Better instructions will come soon.

## I found a bug!

Likely. Please open a issue above. Videos, screenshots, proof of OSRS science, etc is appreciated. I want this to be a faithful re-implementation of OSRS and all bugs are appreciated.

## Can I contribute?

Sure. Right now the code is undergoing rapid development and the API is not stable. I am open to pull requests but I suggest you start small and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Z3ZyY7Yzt5), specifically the #development room.

## Development notes

### Developing the project from this project (with the "sample" environment):

    npm run start

Open up http://localhost:8000 in the browser.

### Developing the project from a client project:

Modify `package.json`:

    -  "main": "_bundles/main.js",
    +  "main": "src/sdk/index.js",
    -  "files": []

From this project:

    npm link

From client project

    npm link osrs-sdk

When done, revert the changes to `package.json` and `npm unlink osrs-sdk`, and re-install `osrs-sdk` at the desired SDK version.

### Running tests

    npx jest
